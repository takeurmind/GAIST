Apparel Classifier - Using CPU Model


This is a project initiated with the aim of creating a Fashion-MNIST based garment image classifier model through CPU model optimization (lightweight) from a DevOps perspective.

If you use obtimaized lightweight CPU only Model not GPU
you can make some effects.

01 High performance
02 Improved runtime and increase resource utilization
03 Reduce costs
04 Increasing Energy Efficiency
05 Efficient use of corporate resource

It will be the breakthrough solutions for maintaining performance and reducing costs

• Size the data and borrow Fashion-MNIST-based clothing models for Object Detection/Classifier
• Depending on the application of Dataset, other classifiers can also be applied



Enjoy.
